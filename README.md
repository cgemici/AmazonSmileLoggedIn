A minimal firefox add-on to redirect requests to www.amazon.(com/de/co.uk) which seem to be the only domains supporting it to the smile.amazon subdomain but only if you're logged in. The main reason this was created is because I like being able to browse amazon without being logged in and then change to my amazon container to buy things.

This add-on checks for the amazon cookie and only redirects you to smile if you're logged in so if you're in a different container or a private window it will do nothing.

If you find any issues feel free to report them here. But since this was just something I made quickly I don't have plans to add anything extra.
